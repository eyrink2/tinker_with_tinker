I'm writing to ask about research opportunities in your group focused on climate applications.\n\n This past summer at ICEYE, I built computer vision algorithms to automatically detect features in and co-register SAR satellite imagery. I also laid the framework for fine-tuning foundational vision models to improve segmentation capabilities but did not have time to finish the project before my internship ended (attaching SAR Algorithms PDF for more context).\n\n I am deeply interested in your work applying ML to climate problems -- especially your work utilizing satellite imagery to promote sustainable development + assess livelihood impact of electricity access. In fact, my first foray into research was a project using NASA data to optimize disaster response logistics. I would greatly appreciate discussing potential research opportunities within your group!\n\n Warmly, Eyrin"}]}
