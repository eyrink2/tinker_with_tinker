    "## HW2: Deep Personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous homework, you experimented with alignment methods including few-shot prompting, instruction tuning, RLHF, and DPO. Those experiments used general chat data to align a pre-trained model into a generally helpful assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, helpfulness is often subjective. For example, while RLHF models tend to produce longer outputs, you may prefer short and concise responses when generating emails. In this assignment, you'll explore machine learning techniques to personalize model behavior to individual preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of LLM Personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM Personalization encompasses the methodical application of machine learning techniques to customize large language model behavior based on user-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/overview.jpg\" alt=\"Overview\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic methodology is supervised fine-tuning (SFT) from CS224N—remember the sonnet generation assignment? 🙂 This is a widely used method especially before ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/sft.jpg\" alt=\"SFT\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of the SFT method is that it requires the user to label desired outputs. This process is not only time-consuming but often infeasible for non-technical users. In this assignment, you'll explore alternative personalization methods that reduce this human effort barrier. Through hands-on experimentation, you'll analyze the pros and cons of different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use **Tinker**, the cutting-edge training API developed by Thinking Machine Labs for this assignment. Besides following this handout, **we highly recommend checking out [Tinker Cookbook](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/) to understand Tinker abstraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that Tinker handles the heavy computation for forward and backward passes. As a result, the remaining code can run on your laptop even during model training.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to use [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site) to monitor the training process. Create an account if you don't have one yet, and make sure to add your API key to the `.env` file."

    "1. **Install Tinker**: Run the following cells to install the Tinker API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect your personalized data**: Make a copy of `data.example.json` and rename this file to `data.json`. Add 10 data points in the format `{\"input\": \"...\", \"output\": \"...\"}` for email generation. The outputs should come from your own emails to better reflect your personal writing style.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    **Recall the lecture on \"Data, Data, and Data\", the similar logic applies here. Please ensure the emails you choose are representative to your style and cover diverse topic. Ensure the \"input\" instruction provides all necessary context (e.g., name, intent), similar to your request to LLM when you want to use LLM to get your things done.**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Bonus (10 points):** While we expect most students to work on the email generation task, we encourage you to explore creative data sources for personalization. If you choose to collect `{\"input\": \"...\", \"output\": \"...\"}` pairs from a different domain (not email generation), you may need to modify some parts of the provided code below.\n",
    "   \n",

If the synthetic output quality is inadequate, consider implementing advanced techniques such as [chain-of-thought prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot), [self-critique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11738), or other approaches that allocate more test-time compute to improve quality.\n",

    "\n",
    "In HW1, you experimented with one approach to RL-based personalization by labeling your own preference pairs and training the model with DPO. Here, we introduce **RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback)**, a method that replaces human preference labels with AI-generated feedback. Instead of manually comparing outputs, we train a reward model to automatically evaluate which outputs better match our criteria. This dramatically reduces human labeling effort while still enabling preference-based learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create a Reward Function using LLM-as-a-Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "For subjective tasks like email generation, a typical approach is to use an LLM-as-a-judge as the reward function. We will use the [pairwise preference collection](https://huggingface.co/datasets/prometheus-eval/Preference-Collection) from [Prometheus Eval](https://github.com/prometheus-eval/prometheus-eval). Unlike other pairwise preference datasets, Prometheus Eval includes explicit rubrics that ground the preference judgments. This is particularly suitable for personalization tasks, since personalized preferences may differ from general preferences—and we can specify our personalized requirements directly in the rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1.1 - Train the reward model (10 points):** We have defined preference data types in `rubric_preference_types.py` (**you DON'T need to change it**). Train the reward model based on `Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507` using `train_rubric_rm.py` by running `python -m scripts.train_rubric_rm {other arguments}` under the root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Important:** Training the reward model takes over 1 hour, as the dataset contains 199,760 instances. We strongly recommend running the script in [tmux](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/) to ensure your job continues running even if you disconnect. **Don't leave this step until the last minute!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1.2 - Design and validate your rubric (10 points):** Design a rubric to evaluate your personalized emails. Use your trained reward model to compare the baseline output and SFT checkpoint output. Verify that the reward model's judgments align with your own preferences. If the reward model performs poorly, consider adjusting your rubric or returning to Step 1.1 to tune hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Bonus: Demonstration-Iterated Task Optimization (DITTO) (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the main assignment! You've explored three personalization approaches: prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning with synthetic data, and reinforcement learning. However, developing a trustworthy reward model remains challenging, which has motivated approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that eliminate the need for explicit reward models. The primary challenge with applying DPO to personalization lies in obtaining sufficient pairwise comparisons from individual users—as you may have experienced in HW1, the labeling process can be tedious and mentally demanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recent work [1] introduces **DITTO (Demonstration-Iterated Task Optimization)**, which addresses this limitation by efficiently generating online comparison data. DITTO treats users' demonstrations as preferred examples and contrasts them against outputs from the base LLM and its intermediate training checkpoints, thereby creating the necessary preference pairs without extensive manual labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/ditto.jpg\" alt=\"DITTO\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task:** Implement DITTO (Algorithm 1 in the paper) using Tinker in `scripts/ditto_dpo.py` and launch a training run with your collected seed data. Compare DITTO's performance against the three methods you implemented earlier (prompt engineering, SFT with synthetic data, and RLAIF). In your analysis, discuss:\n",
    "- How does DITTO's performance compare to other methods?\n",
    "- What advantages does DITTO offer in terms of data efficiency and ease of use?\n",
    "- Are there any limitations or trade-offs you observed?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add your answer in writeup.md**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "1. **Implementation Scope:** You only need to implement the DPO component. For the initialization step \"$\\pi_0 \\leftarrow \\text{SFT}(\\pi_{\\text{ref}}, \\mathcal{D}_{E}), t = 0$\", use `scripts/sft.py` you completed previously. When configuring the SFT step, follow the paper's guidance on hyperparameters: \"For a dataset, we train with SFT until BCE train loss on a given batch approaches 1.00 (early stopping); ideally, we want an LLM to not overfit entirely to demos before DPO.\"\n",
    "2. **Core Algorithm:** The key innovation of DITTO is constructing preference pairs dynamically during training. As detailed in Section 3.2 (\"A Practical Algorithm\"), implement the following preference pair distribution:\n",
    " - 70% on-policy comparisons (i.e., ground truth v.s. current policy output)\n",
    " - 20% replay comparisons (i.e., ground truth v.s. old checkpoint output)\n",
    " - 10% intermodel comparisons (i.e., new checkpooint output v.s. old checkpoint output)\n",
    " Your main task is implementing this data construction logic. The DPO update mechanism itself is standardized and available through the [official implementation](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker-cookbook/blob/main/tinker_cookbook/preference/train_dpo.py) in Tinker Cookbook.\n",
    "3. **Training and Evaluation:** As its name implied, DITTO is designed for data efficiency, so train using only the 10 demonstrations you collected initially. When evaluating DITTO against your earlier implementations, ensure fair comparison by testing on new, previously unseen inputs.\n",
